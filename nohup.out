ruby: No such file or directory -- ./test.rb (LoadError)

This is a test of file writing capabilities!

Writes are fast, and keys seem to be reasonable.

We really need to have a different nonce, though. Oh wait.. it may be working just fine. Yeah. It is.

We can see if this works?
include ./test.rb;

include 'test.rb'

IMPORTANT: FIX ACE<->SERVER INCONSISTENCIES!!
